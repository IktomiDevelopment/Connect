Currently in the VERY early stages of development.
I do NOT have the SQL file for the database uploaded. If you would like the SQL file to create the database just shoot me an email at danny@dewdevelopment.com
This is meant to be a fairly simple dating app for people that follow personal development leaders. The search criteria is currently almost nonexistent.
This is in the earliest stages of development.  It is "functional" in the smallest sence that the website works. However it needs A LOT more functionality added (such as search criteria as an example).
There are numerous other things that need to be added as well.
Further the site is coded using super basic HTML/CSS and needs something a lot more industrial strength.
Development of this will switch pretty soon to Angular.
If you have any questions feel free to reach out by email and ask.
